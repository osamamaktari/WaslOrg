                        Like any high school girl, my only concern was excelling in my studies and achieving excellent grades. I was extremely shy and disliked participating in any activities. The very idea of standing up to deliver a segment in the school broadcast was terrifying
                        to me, as anxiety and nervousness dominated my personality. But suddenly, everything changed when I was selected as one of the Peace Ambassadors in a project launched by Wasl for Peace in 2019 in the schools of Taiz Governorate.
                        I began attending training sessions and earned the title of “Ambassador,” a title that awakened a beautiful sense of responsibility and challenge within me. I was determined to be the best and to make my school a model to follow
                        among other schools. Even though the experience was entirely new to us as students, the six days of training were pivotal moments in my life and brought about a profound transformation in me. The once introverted and shy girl became
                        a Peace Ambassador, gaining a confidence I had never known before. Every time I was called by my name as an ambassador, that word infused me with an unfamiliar yet uplifting positive energy. I started participating in various activities,
                        the most significant of which was being part of the “Happy Arabia” project team, which contributes to the development of school students. We implemented the project in five schools, leaving a significant impact. I began to see
                        myself in every girl who benefited from it. Today, I am Sarah, who no longer believes in the impossible, after once seeing everything as unattainable. I became the ambassador who achieved her dreams and reached her aspirations.
                        I now work as a coordinator for the “Peace Ambassadors” initiative project, supported by the Youth Without Borders Organization. I have become an inspiration to those around me, instilling confidence and hope in their hearts and
                        fostering an ambitious spirit that knows no obstacles. With pride and gratitude, I am a volunteer with Wasl for Peace. Everything I have achieved today is thanks to God and then to this organization and its project, through which
                        I found myself and discovered talents and capabilities that were hidden within me. I am deeply thankful to them for everything—their trust in me, their encouragement, and their continuous support.

                        At Al-Shaab School, there was an energetic young man with a beautiful spirit who loved volunteering and had a strong desire to participate in any community or humanitarian work through which he could serve people and the society around him. His wish came
                        true in 2019 when the Wasl for Peace organization team arrived at his school with their “Peace Ambassadors” project. The students received training in leadership and peacebuilding skills, and then returned to their schools to establish
                        Peace Ambassador teams across schools in Taiz Governorate. A broad smile formed on his face, and he told himself, “This is my chance to enter this field.” He was the first to apply for the personal interviews for the Peace Ambassadors
                        program at his school. He passed the interview and became one of the program’s volunteers on his school’s team. He wasn’t an ordinary person—he put in a lot of effort, focused on honing his skills, and developing his abilities
                        to become someone who could carve his path in the future. He truly became that person, and the program was his launchpad. After graduating from high school, he joined many initiatives and organizations, where he worked as both
                        a participating member and a coordinator for various activities and programs. In 2022, this young man, Bashar Al-Huraibi, became an official volunteer at the Wasl for Peace organization. He is also a leader in many initiatives
                        and organizations, including serving as the scouting leader at Al-Talia Club, Director of the Youth and Sports Office in the Youth and Children’s Government of Yemen, and a member of the Yemeni Union for Sports Media in Taiz, among
                        other roles. Bashar, now 20 years old, proves to everyone that age is not a barrier to success. He shows that with effort and continuous work on oneself, you can achieve what you aspire to. Just seize the opportunities when they
                        come because they only come once in a lifetime.
